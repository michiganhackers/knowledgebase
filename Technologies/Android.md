* [Android Studio Keyboard Shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/keyboard-shortcuts)
  *  Lists all the keyboard shortcuts Android Studio offers by default.
  *  These can save a lot of time, so it's highly recommended to read through it to see what exists and bookmark it to reference later.
  *  If you don't know the shortcut for something, you can always find it with "Find Action" (Control + Shift + A or Command + Shift + A). This will also tell you the shortcut for the action if it exists.
