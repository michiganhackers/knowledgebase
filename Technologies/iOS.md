# iOS

Hi! Do you want to learn how to make apps for iOS? You've come to the right place! The resources on this page are designed for someone with no or a little iOS development experience. However, some prior programming experience is suggested. If you'd like to dive in, go ahead! We're not stopping you. However, if you're an absolute beginner, we have some great resources on our [landing page](link).

## Getting Started

Getting started with any new technology is tough, especially if you don't have much prior programming experience. If you've never programmed before, get your feet wet by going through one of the following excellent free online courses.

- [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs/programming)
- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)

Both of these will give you a solid foundation in JavaScript, a language widely used in interactive websites and servers. JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language, designed with the same principals in mind as many other popular languages. Gaining a familiarity with JavaScript will prepare you to jump into iOS, Android, Mac, PC, or Web development.
