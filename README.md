Michigan Hackers' Knowledgebase
=============

Hi! Do you want to learn how to make real stuff? Mobile? Web? Hardware? You've come to the right place! The resources on this page are designed for everyone from absolute beginners to experienced developers.



## Getting Started

Getting started with any new technology is tough, especially if you don't have much prior programming experience. If you've never programmed before, get your feet wet by going through one of the following excellent free online courses.

- [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs/programming)
- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)

Both of these will give you a solid foundation in JavaScript, a language widely used in interactive websites and servers. JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language, designed with the same principals in mind as many other popular languages. Gaining a familiarity with JavaScript will prepare you to jump into iOS, Android, Mac, PC, or Web development.
